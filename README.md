**Breathing LED** <br />
A “breathing LED” is a situation where an LED’s brightness smoothly changes from dark to bright and back to dark. It's implemented with help of arduino Uno.

<br />

**RGB LED** <br />
In this expriment an RGB LED is controled by 3 potentiometer.

<br />

**Guess the Number Game** <br />
Two arduinos playing "guess the Number" and connected by UART protocol.

<br />

**HW1** <br />
This experiment contains a program and the appropriate circuit design that control the speed of
a brushed DC motor with the help of a MOSFET (IRFZ44N). And the user is able to change the motor’s
speed by setting a potentiometer to the desired value.

<br />

**HW2** <br />
The experiment’s objective was to design a basic security system, further information is available on the documentation.

<br />

**HW3** <br />
In this experiment we used TIMER1 to generate a PWM signal on pin 4. (This pins is not connected
to any hardware PWM generation unit)

<br />

**HW4** <br />
In this experiment, a hypothetical communication system designed, which has only one slave right now. And a master just send that specific slave a 
hardcoded string message every 5 seconds and the slave prints that message on the Serial interface.
