**HW1**

This experiment contains a program and the appropriate circuit design that control the speed of
a brushed DC motor with the help of a MOSFET (IRFZ44N). And the user is able to change the motor’s
speed by setting a potentiometer to the desired value.



**HW2**

The experiment’s objective was to design a basic security system, further information is available on the documentation.



**HW3**

In this experiment we used TIMER1 to generate a PWM signal on pin 4. (This pins is not connected
to any hardware PWM generation unit)
